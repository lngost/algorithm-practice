algorithm-practice
==================
Personal practice of algorithm and data structure by using c.

C99 standard is used by default for practice purpose, but other standards may be used when necessary. 
Check "Makefile" in each project folder, standard is specified by "-std=" option.

------
#### Which compiler used?
* Apple LLVM version 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53) (based on LLVM 3.6.0svn).

#### How to compile and run?
* Each c project contains "Makefile".
* Type `make` to compile, type `./<executable_file_name>` to run.

#### How to clean executable and .o files?
* Type `make clean` to clean .o files.
* Type `make clean-all` to clean executable and .o files.

------
#### Others
* Normally a "pseudocode.txt" file is placed under each project folder, and most of work 
inside the file is based on the following book:  
    *Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition* (ISBN 978-0-262-03384-8).  
Others are from websites.
* All efforts have been taken to make the work correct for the purpose of best practice, 
but NO GUARANTEES are made.
